## 💡 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build shared package
cd packages/shared && npm run build && cd ../..

# Start frontend development server
npm run dev:frontend

# Start backend development server (requires PostgreSQL)
npm run dev:backend

# Run type checking
cd packages/frontend && npm run type-check
```

## 📝 Notes
- Docker is not installed on the development machine, so PostgreSQL needs to be set up separately for backend development
- The application runs in demo mode with mock data when Firebase/backend is not configured
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- The monorepo structure is working correctly with proper type sharing between packages

## 🎉 Summary
The HireDesk platform now has a fully functional frontend with equipment browsing, basket management, quote creation, and PDF generation. The architecture is solid, TypeScript types are properly configured, and the application is ready for the next phase of development focusing on admin features and cloud deployment.
