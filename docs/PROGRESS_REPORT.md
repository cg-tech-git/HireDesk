   - Rate card management
   - Vertex AI Search integration

2. **Quote System**
   - Quote calculation service
   - Quote controller (create, update, submit)
   - PDF generation service (using Puppeteer)
   - Quote validation logic

3. **Services Management**
   - Service controller for add-on services
   - Service pricing logic

4. **User Management**
   - User profile updates
   - Role-based permissions

#### Frontend Pages & Components
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Registration page
   - Password reset flow
   - Profile management

2. **Equipment Catalog**
   - Category browsing page
   - Equipment listing with search
   - Equipment detail page
   - Natural language search integration

3. **Quote Flow**
   - RFQ basket component
   - Date picker for equipment
   - Quote review page
   - PDF download functionality

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Rate card management UI
   - User management
   - Quote template configuration

### Phase 2: Cloud Integration
- Google Cloud Storage for images

- Vertex AI Search implementation
- Gmail API integration

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests with Cypress/Playwright
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- Performance optimization

## 📋 Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Fix TypeScript path aliases** - The `@/` imports need proper configuration
2. **Install missing dependencies** - @emotion/server, react-query-devtools
3. **Add API route mounting** - Connect route files to Express app
4. **Configure TypeORM CLI** - For migrations and seeding
5. **Add validation middleware** - Integrate Zod schemas with Express routes
6. **Implement repository pattern** - For better data access abstraction

## 🎯 Next Development Session

1. Fix the TypeScript configuration for module aliases
2. Create equipment and category controllers
3. Implement the quote calculation engine
4. Build the equipment catalog frontend pages
5. Set up the RFQ basket functionality

## 📊 Estimated Completion

- **Phase 1 (Core Functionality)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Cloud Integration)**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (Production Ready)**: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time to MVP: 4-7 weeks

## 🛠️ Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d

# Build shared package
cd packages/shared && npm run build && cd ../..

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

The application structure is in place and ready for continued development. The next session should focus on completing the core business logic for equipment management and quote generation.
